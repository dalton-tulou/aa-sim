# Axis & Allies Combat Simulator

This program is intended as a help for players to make decisions about combat in Hasbro's board game _Axis & Allies_.

The user will enter what units are to conduct the battle, and the program will run a large number of simulations to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

The simulation results are presented in the form of a histogram.
